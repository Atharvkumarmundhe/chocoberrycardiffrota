# 🍓 Chocoberry Rota Calculator  

The **Chocoberry Rota Calculator** is a web-based rota planner I built while working part-time at **Chocoberry, Cardiff**. It helps calculate total working hours for all employees and generates a **print-friendly professional rota layout** for staff management.  

## 💡 About the Project  
I created this rota system to simplify weekly schedule management at my workplace. Instead of manually calculating every employee’s hours, this tool automates the process — saving time and reducing errors.  

## ✨ Features  
- 📆 Add employee names, roles, and shift timings for each day.  
- ⏱️ Automatically calculates total working hours per employee.  
- 🖨️ One-click print option with a **clean professional design**.  
- 🧮 Smart time parser (supports overnight shifts and “CLOSE” keyword).  
- 🧰 Built with pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no external libraries.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML5** – for structure  
- **CSS3** – for modern dark UI and print styling  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – for calculations and interactivity  

## 📋 How It Works  
1. Enter employee names, roles, and start–end times in the table.  
2. Click **“📊 Calculate Hours”** to view each worker’s total.  
3. Use **“🖨️ Print Rota”** to generate a professional print layout.  
4. You can also clear everything using **“🗑️ Clear All”**.  

## 🖨️ Print Mode  
The print view automatically switches to a clean white layout with clear borders and headings, ideal for displaying in the workplace.  

## 🔮 Future Plans  
- Add export options (PDF or Excel).  
- Allow data saving between sessions.  
- Add a dashboard for multiple weeks.
